                        <p> Selling it to
                            a private buyer, on the other hand, may
                            entail the hassle of gathering all of
                            the necessary
                            paperwork, contacting and arranging a
                            meeting with the buyers, safely

                            transferring
                            the title, and potentially costing you
                            more time and money.
